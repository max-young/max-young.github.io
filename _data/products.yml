  description: >
    Independently developed a sophisticated calibration software system for autonomous vehicle sensors (cameras, radars), revolutionizing the process by automating operations and reducing communication overhead.
    The solution significantly enhanced factory calibration efficiency for hundreds of new vehicles, increasing daily throughput from 2-3 to 10+ vehicles.
    Streamlined field calibration procedures allowed maintenance teams to complete on-site calibrations in under 30 minutes, compared to the previous 0.5-1 day timeframe.
    This comprehensive calibration platform bridged the gap between manufacturing and field operations, ensuring consistent sensor performance and improved safety for autonomous vehicle fleets.

    Realistic PBR is realized by using OpenGL and GLSL. Different spheres have different normal distribution and roughness, so as to calculate different NDF and mask functions, and then calculate different fresnel equation reflectivity according to different metallic, so as to calculate Different BRDFs get different lighting effects.
    This also includes the effect of using cubemap to get skybox.
