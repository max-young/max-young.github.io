use `-` or `_` in the URL?

both `-` and `_` are more readable than space, because space will encode to `%20`.  
but it's prefer to use `-` in the URL.  
for example, we have pamameters keyword `hello world`, we can use `hello-world` or `hello_world` in the URL.  
but in the google search, `hello_world` is same to `helloworld`, `hello-world` is same to `hello world`, the search result is different.  
two keywords `hello` and `world` is what we want. so it's prefer to use `-` in the URL.
