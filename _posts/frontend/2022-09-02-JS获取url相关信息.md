获取arguments
```javascript
const queryString = window.location.search;
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
const product = urlParams.get('product')
```

suppose that you have a page with this address: http://sub.domain.com/virtualPath/page.htm. use the following in page code to achieve those results:

- window.location.host : you'll get sub.domain.com:8080 or sub.domain.com:80  
- window.location.hostname : you'll get sub.domain.com  
- window.location.protocol : you'll get http:  
- window.location.port : you'll get 8080 or 80  
- window.location.pathname : you'll get /virtualPath  
- window.location.origin : you'll get http://sub.domain.com
