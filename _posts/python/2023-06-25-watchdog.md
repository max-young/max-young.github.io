the scenerio is:  
when a new file is created in a folder, we want to do something with it.  
we can use watchdog, example code is below:

```python
import logging
import time

from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
from watchdog.observers import Observer

from app.tasks import push_file_to_volc

path = "/data4/products"


class MyHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    """my handler
    """

    def on_closed(self, event):
        filename = event.src_path.split("/")[-1]
        if filename.startswith("main-") and filename.endswith(".tar"):
            push_file_to_volc.delay(event.src_path)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                        format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s',
                        datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    event_handler = MyHandler()
    observer = Observer()
    observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=False)
    observer.start()
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    finally:
        observer.stop()
        observer.join()
```

One important thing to note is that I customized the `on_closed` method, not the `on_created` method.  
The `on_created` method is triggered when the file is initially created, but it doesn't guarantee that the file has been completely written.  
On the other hand, the `on_closed` method is triggered when the file is closed, indicating that the file has been fully written.  
If we rely on the `on_created` method and the new file is large, there is a risk of ending up with an incomplete file when attempting to copy it to another location.
