gitlab ci requires a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your repository.

#### REACT and gitlab ci

let me show my .gitlab-ci.yml file

```yml
deploy test:
  stage: deploy
  tags:
    - dev-102
  script:
    - cd /home/apollo/test/surge-frontend
    - CI='' git pull
    - git checkout $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
    - CI='' npm run build
```

I have deployed a gitlab runner in the server, and tag the runner with `dev-102`, yml file config tags with `dev-102`, so the job will run in the server.  
let's see the script part, I have clone the repository to the path `/home/apollo/test/surge-frontend` and config the nginx server this path, so next step is `git pull` and `git checkout $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME`, then `npm run build` to build the project.  
in the ci progress, if command has warning, the job will fail, so I add `CI=''` before the command, to ignore the warning.
